## Usual Firefox Telemetry is mostly unaffected

* No change: `main` and other pings are UNAFFECTED by this add-on, except that [shield-studies-addon-utils](https://github.com/mozilla/shield-studies-addon-utils) adds the add-on id as an active experiment in the telemetry environment.
* Respects telemetry preferences. If user has disabled telemetry, no telemetry will be sent.

## Study-specific endings

TBD

## `block-autoplay` pings, specific to THIS study.

The following is the content of the raw payload in the ping.
